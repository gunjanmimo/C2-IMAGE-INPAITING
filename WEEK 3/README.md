# WEEK 3: IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING CHAN VESE METHOD 

Before diving deep into Chan-Vese segmentation method, you will discuss about **Mumford-Shah** segmentation problem to understand the background of the problem. 

The Chan-Vese method is inspired by the Mumford-Shah model. They approximate the image by:

They suggest selecting this edge set C as the segmentation boundary. Mumford-Shah implies 4 criteria:

1) The segmentation results in an image.
   \[f \rightarrow u\]

2) The segmented image is like the original image.
   \[\int_\Omega (f(x) - u(x))^2 \, dx\]

3) The segmented regions are homogeneous.
   \[\int_{\frac{\Omega}{C}}\left|\nabla u(x)\right|^2dx\]

4) The segmented regions have smooth boundaries.
   \[\arg_{u,C}(\mu Length(C))\]

Summing the criteria, we get 3 terms:
   \[\arg_{u,C}(\mu Length(C)) + \lambda \int (f(x) - u(x))^2 \, dx + \int\left|\nabla u(x)\right|^2dx\]

Where C is the edge set curve and u is discontinuous.

1: Ensures regularity of C.
2: Ensures u to be close to f.
3: Ensured u is differentiable on \(\frac{\Omega}{C}\).

Mumford-Shah models are complicated and computationally expensive. As a simplification, we consider a piecewise constant formulation and a fifth criterion:

5) The segmentation image has two regions.
   \[\arg_{u,C}(\mu Length(C)) + \lambda \int (f(x) - u(x))^2 \, dx + \int\left|\nabla u(x)\right|^2dx\]

Where u is allowed to have only 2 values:
   
   \[u(x) = \begin{cases} 
      u_1(x), & \text{if } x \in C_1 \\
      u_2(x), & \text{if } x \notin C_2 
   \end{cases}\]

So we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[\arg_{u,C}(\mu Length(C)) + v \text{Area (inside(C))} + \lambda_1 \int_{\text{inside}(C)} (f(x) - c_1)^2 \, dx + \lambda_2 \int_{\text{outside}(C)} (f(x) - c_2)^2 \, dx\]

By finding a local minimizer of this problem, we obtain a segmentation as the best two-phase piecewise approximation u of the image f.
To minimize the function, we need to minimize over all set boundaries C.

C = \{x \in \Omega : \varphi(x) = 0 \}

The inside and outside of C are distinguished by \(\varphi \) which is a level set function for a circle of radius r.

\[\varphi(x) = r - \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}\]

For a given C, there is more than one possible level set representation.
If \(\varphi \) is a level set of \(\Omega \), then so is any other function \(\psi \) having the same sign:

\[\text{sign}(\psi(x)) = \text{sign}(\psi(x))\]

=> \[\arg_{c_1,c_2,\varphi}(\mu \int_{\Omega}  \delta \left(\varphi(x)\,|\nabla\varphi(x)|\right) \, dx +  v \int_{\Omega} H \left(\varphi(x)\right) dx +  \lambda_1 \int_{\Omega}  \left|f(x) - c_1\right|^2 H( \varphi(x)) \, dx +  \lambda_2 \int_{\Omega}  \left|f(x) - c_2\right|^2 (1 - H( \varphi(x))) \, dx\]

Where H denotes the Heaviside function and the \(\delta \) the Dirac mass, its distributional derivative,

\[H(t) = \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } t \geq 0 \\
   0 & \text{if } t < 0
\end{cases}\]

\[\delta(t) = \frac{d}{dt} H(t) \]

Length of C is obtained as the total variation of \( H(\varphi) \).

\[\text{Length(C)} =  \int_{\Omega} |\nabla H \varphi(x)|\right) \, dx =  \int_{\Omega}\delta( \varphi(x)) |\nabla \varphi(x)|\right) \, dx.\]

The minimization is solved by alternatingly updating \( c_1 \),\( c_2 \), and \( \varphi \). For a fixed \( \varphi \), the optimal values of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are the region averages.

\[ c_1 = \frac{\int_{\Omega} f(x) H(\varphi(x)) \, dx}{\int_{\Omega} H(\varphi(x)) \, dx} \]

\[ c_2 = \frac{\int_{\Omega} f(x) (1 - H(\varphi(x))) \, dx}{\int_{\Omega}( 1 -  H(\varphi(x))) \, dx} \]

For the minimization with respect to \( \varphi \), H is regularized as:

\[ H_\epsilon(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{2}{\pi} \arctan\left(\frac{t}{\epsilon}\right)\right) \]
